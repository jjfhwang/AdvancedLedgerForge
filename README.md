# AdvancedLedgerForge: A Toolkit for Building Decentralized Ledger Applications

AdvancedLedgerForge is a robust TypeScript-based toolkit designed to streamline the development of decentralized ledger applications. It provides a set of pre-built components, utility functions, and standardized interfaces, allowing developers to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy secure and efficient ledger systems. This framework abstracts away many of the complexities inherent in distributed ledger technology, enabling developers to focus on the specific business logic and features of their applications.

This project aims to be more than just a library; it's a comprehensive scaffolding solution. We understand that building reliable and scalable ledger applications can be a daunting task, especially when considering aspects like data integrity, consensus mechanisms, and secure transaction handling. AdvancedLedgerForge addresses these challenges by providing a modular architecture that allows for customization and extension. Whether you're building a supply chain tracking system, a digital asset management platform, or a decentralized identity solution, this toolkit provides the foundational building blocks you need.

The core benefit of AdvancedLedgerForge lies in its ability to accelerate development cycles and reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. By leveraging established best practices and rigorously tested components, developers can avoid common pitfalls and focus on delivering value to their users. Furthermore, the toolkit's modular design allows for easy integration with existing systems and databases, ensuring a smooth transition and minimal disruption. This makes AdvancedLedgerForge ideal for both greenfield projects and the modernization of legacy systems.

AdvancedLedgerForge is not tied to any specific blockchain technology. The intention is to provide generic ledger capabilities, capable of being bound to concrete implementations. Currently, the primary focus is on providing memory-backed and file-backed ledger implementations, to provide immediate, easily-debugged functionalities. Future integrations will include established distributed ledger platforms, providing a seamless experience.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Ledger Core:** The core ledger implementation is designed with modularity in mind, allowing developers to easily extend or replace components such as the transaction validation mechanism, state management system, and consensus algorithm (when implemented).
*   **Secure Transaction Handling:** Built-in support for cryptographic signing and verification of transactions ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications to the ledger. Transaction structures are defined with TypeScript interfaces for strong typing and compile-time safety. For example, transaction data is signed using `ECDSA` with `SHA256` hashes.
*   **State Management:** An efficient and scalable state management system allows for the storage and retrieval of ledger data. The system supports versioning and auditing, providing a complete history of all changes made to the ledger.  This is implemented using a persistent key-value store with optimized read and write operations.
*   **Event Handling:** A robust event handling mechanism allows applications to react to changes in the ledger state in real-time. Developers can subscribe to specific events and receive notifications whenever a relevant transaction is processed. Events are emitted using the `EventEmitter` pattern.
*   **Data Validation:** Built-in data validation rules ensure that only valid transactions are added to the ledger. Developers can define custom validation rules to enforce specific business logic and prevent invalid data from being committed. Validation logic is implemented using TypeScript decorators and custom validation functions.
*   **Memory and File Based Implementations**: Provides implementations to run ledger capabilities locally, without needing a network. Ledger data is stored in memory or on a file. This facilitates rapid prototyping, testing, and debugging.
*   **TypeScript Support:** Written entirely in TypeScript, providing type safety, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer productivity. The codebase is heavily commented and follows established best practices.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language used for building the toolkit. TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the toolkit's code. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that is well-suited for building high-performance applications.
*   **Jest:** A testing framework used for writing unit and integration tests. Jest provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests and supports mocking, code coverage, and other advanced testing features.
*   **ESLint:** A linter used for enforcing code style and preventing common errors. ESLint helps ensure that the codebase is consistent and readable.
*   **Prettier:** A code formatter used for automatically formatting code according to a predefined set of rules. Prettier helps ensure that the codebase is consistently formatted and easy to read.

## Installation

1.  **Install Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm (version 8 or higher) installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website.

2.  **Clone the repository:** Clone the AdvancedLedgerForge repository from GitHub using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/AdvancedLedgerForge.git

3.  **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

    cd AdvancedLedgerForge
    npm install

## Configuration

The toolkit can be configured using environment variables. The following environment variables are supported:

*   `LEDGER_DATA_DIR`: Specifies the directory where ledger data is stored (if using a file-based ledger). Defaults to `./ledger-data`.
*   `LEDGER_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL`: Specifies the interval (in milliseconds) at which ledger snapshots are created. Defaults to `60000` (1 minute).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Specifies the log level. Supported values are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. Defaults to `info`.

You can set these environment variables in your `.env` file or directly in your shell. For example:

LEDGER_DATA_DIR=/path/to/ledger/data
LOG_LEVEL=debug

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the AdvancedLedgerForge toolkit to create and interact with a ledger:

// Import the necessary modules
import { Ledger } from './src/ledger';
import { Transaction } from './src/transaction';

// Create a new ledger instance
const ledger = new Ledger();

// Create a new transaction
const transaction: Transaction = {
    from: 'Alice',
    to: 'Bob',
    amount: 10
};

// Add the transaction to the ledger
ledger.addTransaction(transaction);

// Get the current balance of Alice
const aliceBalance = ledger.getBalance('Alice');

console.log(`Alice's balance: ${aliceBalance}`);

The API documentation for all classes and functions is available in the project's source code. Refer to the TypeScript type definitions for detailed information on available methods, parameters, and return values.
